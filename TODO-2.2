Things to do for release 2.2:

Marko: databraid FTBE added to test/doc/code. Please look things over, especially in the guide.

JLT: check documentation.  Consistent naming of option flags?
(upper/lower)

Remember to make a branch for continued development after release
2.2.  Maybe a branch called devel?  master would then always hold the
latest.
